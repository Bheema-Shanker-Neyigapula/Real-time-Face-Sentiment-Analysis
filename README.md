# Real-time-Face-Sentiment-Analysis
 In this project, we'll use spaCy for named entity recognition, Hugging Face Transformers for sentiment analysis, and OpenCV for real-time face detection. We'll then create an interactive graphical interface using Tkinter to display sentiment analysis results and named entities on a live webcam feed.
